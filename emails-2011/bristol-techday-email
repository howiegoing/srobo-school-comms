Hello Teams!

You've been busily building, prototyping and bodging your robots for a couple of months now. The Bristol branch of Student Robotics thought we'd welcome you all into our university for a tech day. This will be an excellent opportunity to get help on any issues you're having with programming, electronics or mechanics. Feel like spying on the competition? We're hoping to have teams from across the UK here, so you can see exactly how you're doing in comparison with everyone else. The tech day will be in the Merchant Venturer's building on the 12th of February from 9:30 in the morning until 5 in the evening, so there will be plenty of time to get help and boost your robot to the next level of awesomeness. Please reply to sphippen@studentrobotics.org if you'd like to come along, we need a minimum of 7 days notice in order to get you accounts on the university computers.

Where: Bristol University, Merchant Venturer's building
When: 12th of February 9:30-5

Please note: this tech day is in addition to University of Southampton days but all schools are very welcome!

A Message from the SR Development Team

We have been working hard to obtain the funds from the bank and get your kit to you. While the bank has now released the funds, unfortunately we think we will now not be able to ship the kit before Christmas. We realise you are all working hard on your robots and want to get your hands on the electronics so we are doing our best to get it ready as soon as possible. Sorry for all the pushed back deadlines, if only you could do the same with homework!

You should still have plenty to do on your robots however and if you want to practice some programming before the kit arrives, have a look in the forums for information[1][2]
